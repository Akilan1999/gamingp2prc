# P2P rendering and computation

The main aim of this project was to create a custom peer to peer network. The user acting as the
client has total flexibility on how to batch the tasks and the user acting as the server has complete
flexibility on tracking the container's usages and killing the containers at any point of time. A
prototype has been implemented that helped to meet the functional requirements of the project.
A thorough evaluation of the prototype has been performed.

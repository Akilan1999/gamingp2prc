# Design Architecture

This chapter focuses on architecture of the dissertation. The objective would be to have a good
understanding on the purpose of each module and how they interact with each other. The design
architecture was inspired and based on the linux kernel design. The project is segmented into
various modules. Each module is responsible for certain tasks in the project. The modules are
highly dependent on each other hence the entire codebase can be considered as a huge monolithic
chuck which acts as its own library. The following sub topics below talk about the main modules
and how they function with appropriate diagrams.

### 1. [Client Module](ClientArchitecture.md)
### 2. [P2P Module](P2PArchitecture.md)
### 3. [Server Module](ServerArchitecture.md)

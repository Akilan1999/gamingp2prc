P2P rendering and computation
=============================

This project focuses on running heavy tasks which a regular computer can’t run easily such as high
spec video games, rendering 3D animations , protein folding simulations. In this project the major
focus won’t be on the financial incentive part. A peer to peer network will be created to run tasks
decentrally, increasing bandwidth for running tasks . To ensure the tasks in peer to peer network
does not corrupt the server 0S (Operating System) they will be executed in a virtual environment
in the server.
With the introduction of overlay protocols like IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) for websites and
Libp2p, it is easier to create custom peer to peer applications. Using the existing developments of
peer to peer frameworks, a peer to peer application can be created to do any type of rendering or
computation in a distributed environment.
The main aim of this project will be to create a peer to peer network using Libp2p and Kademlia
DHT (Distributed Hash Table) and distribute the rendering of graphical tasks. The user acting as
the client will have total flexibility on how to batch the tasks and the user acting as the server will
have complete flexibility to set how much computation he/she wants to provide to the client.

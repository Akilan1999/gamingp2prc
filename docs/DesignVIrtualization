Virtualization Design
======================

The virtualization tool will be treated as a separate module. In our implementation
we will use docker as it's easier to configure and set. 

Methods to be created
- Build OS Image from DockerFile
- Run Image Built
- Possibility to kill image by server admin or client side user.
- Track stats of the docker container by server admin or client side user.
